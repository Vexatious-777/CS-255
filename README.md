Sys. Analysis &amp; Design


The DriverPass Project was a project for an organization wishing to create a Driver Education Program, hosted on a cloud-based server that would facilitate Instructor/Student training sessions and provide a digital classroom and learning materials for students pursuing DMV licensure. The Client was the DriverPass team, in particular, their CEO and IT Lead were interviewed for Business Requirements for the project.

If I could choose what to revise in this project I would like to revise my UML diagrams to make them as clear as possible to support the development team better.

The interpretation of user needs was implemented into the system design by taking the needs asked for during the interview and turning them into use cases. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because unless you are creating the system for yourself, what they are asking for is what should be created if you asked for something in particular and received something that was not what you asked for how would you feel?

I approach designing software by first getting the big picture of how it's supposed to function and then begin to determine what it will require and what piece of the software will be the foundation the rest will be built into. The techniques and strategies I would use in the future to analyze and design a system would be UML diagramming for sure, however, in my case, I think I would stick to activity and class diagrams, rather than most others. (primarily due to personal prefrence)
